This program calculates the name inputs which gives an output of the the input name and our age in dog years.

### This program is written in the python language.

# How to Use Age Input Software
You input your name which is stored as a string variable and then your age in human years which will be registered and stored as an int variable. 
Then the program will collect the information and calculate the int age input and output your age in dog years. Along with your name and human age years input will be outputed in a `System.out.print`.


# How To Contribute
To contribute, you will have to be using git hub as well as a software like jupyter hub provides. This enables better sharing and editing of public libraries. 
- So first you will go to git hub and fork the code then copy it to your terminal and git clone the link it provided to make a copy file in your domain. 
- Then after in your folder you will see all the code files and text files from the repository and then just make your edits and save it. 
- When you are ready to upload your changes to the repo, go to your terminal and use the git add command for the exact file (each time) and then git push -m and type what changes ypou made briefly so it's saved to the repo visual.
