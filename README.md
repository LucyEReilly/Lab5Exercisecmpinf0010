# Age Input
This program calculates the name inputs which gives an output of the the input name and our age in dog years.

### This program is written in the python language.

# How to Use Age Input Software
You input your name which is stored as a string variable and then your age in human years which will be registered and stored as an int variable. 
Then the program will collect the information and calculate the int age input and output your age in dog years. Along with your name and human age years input will be outputed in a `System.out.print`.


# How To Contribute
To contribute, you will have to be using git hub as well as a software like jupyter hub provides. This enables better sharing and editing of public libraries. 
- So first you will go to git hub and fork the code then copy it to your terminal and git clone the link it provided to make a copy file in your domain. 
- Then after in your folder you will see all the code files and text files from the repository and then just make your edits and save it. 
- When you are ready to upload your changes to the repo, go to your terminal and use the git add command for the exact file (each time) and then git commit -m and type what changes ypou made briefly so it's saved to the repo visual. 
- Then use the git push command to push the value to the repo online, the terminal might ask for username and password(personal access tokens) so just compute that to the terminal.
- When you see main < main then you are good so just go to the repo and create a pull request and wait for the original creator to review your changes and add them to their own repo!
