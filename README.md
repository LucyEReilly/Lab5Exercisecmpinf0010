# Age Input
This program calculates the name inputs which gives an output of the the input name and our age in dog years.

### This program is written in the python language.

# How to Use Age Input Software
You input your name which is stored as a string variable and then your age in human years which will be registered and stored as an int variable. 
Then the program will collect the information and calculate the int age input and output your age in dog years. Along with your name and human age years input will be outputed in a `System.out.print`.
